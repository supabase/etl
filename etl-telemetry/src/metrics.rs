// A [`Mutex`] is used instead of [`Once`], [`OnceCell`], or [`OnceLock`] because the
// initialization code is fallible. Ideally, we would use `OnceLock::get_or_try_init`,
// which allows fallible initialization, but it is currently unstable.
//
// The reason we must initialize only once is that [`PrometheusBuilder::install_recorder`]
// installs a global metrics recorder, and any later calls to it fail. While
// [`init_metrics`] is not called multiple times during normal operations, it is called
// multiple times during tests, so this caching mechanism is essential.

/// This function is designed for web services that need to integrate metrics into their
/// existing HTTP framework (e.g., Actix Web, Axum). Unlike [`init_metrics`], this does
/// not automatically start an HTTP server. Instead, it returns a [`PrometheusHandle`]
/// that the caller uses to manually render metrics at a custom endpoint.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Multiple threads can safely call this method to get a handle. Initialization happens
/// only once, and subsequent calls return cloned handles from the cache.
///
/// # Use Case
///
/// Use this when you want to:
/// - Integrate metrics into an existing web framework.
/// - Control the metrics endpoint path (e.g., `/metrics`, `/v1/metrics`).
/// - Apply middleware or authentication to the metrics endpoint.
