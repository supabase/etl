/// Trait for systems that can receive replicated data from ETL pipelines.

/// [`Destination`] implementations define how replicated data is written to target systems.
/// The trait supports both bulk operations for initial table synchronization and streaming
/// operations for real-time replication events.
///
/// Implementations should ensure idempotent operations where possible, as the ETL system
/// may retry failed operations. The destination should handle concurrent writes safely
/// when multiple table sync workers are active.
