/// # Algorithm Overview
///
/// The apply loop processes three types of events:
/// 1. **Replication messages** - DDL/DML events from Postgres logical replication
/// 2. **Table sync signals** - Coordination events from table synchronization workers
/// 3. **Shutdown signals** - Graceful termination requests from the pipeline
///
/// # Processing Phases
///
/// ## 1. Initialization Phase
/// - Validates hook requirements via `before_loop()` callback.
/// - Establishes logical replication stream from Postgres.
/// - Initializes batch processing state and status tracking.
///
/// ## 2. Event Processing Phase
/// - **Message handling**: Processes replication messages in transaction-aware batches.
/// - **Batch management**: Accumulates events until batch size/time limits are reached.
/// - **Status updates**: Periodically reports progress back to Postgres.
/// - **Coordination**: Manages table sync worker lifecycle and state transitions.
///
/// # Concurrency Model
///
/// The loop uses `tokio::select!` to handle multiple asynchronous operations:
/// - **Priority handling**: Shutdown signals have the highest priority (biased select)
/// - **Message streaming**: Continuously processes replication stream
/// - **Periodic operations**: Status updates and housekeeping every 1 second
/// - **External coordination**: Responds to table sync worker signals
