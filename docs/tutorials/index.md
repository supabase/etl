# Tutorials

**Learn ETL through guided, hands-on experiences**

Tutorials provide step-by-step learning paths that take you from zero knowledge to working applications. Each tutorial is designed to be completed successfully by following the exact steps provided.

## Getting Started

### [Build Your First ETL Pipeline](first-pipeline/)
**15 minutes** • **Beginner** 

Create a complete ETL pipeline that replicates data from PostgreSQL to a memory destination. You'll learn the core concepts of publications, replication slots, and pipeline configuration.

*What you'll build:* A working pipeline that streams changes from a sample PostgreSQL table to an in-memory destination.

## Before You Start

**Prerequisites for all tutorials:**

- Rust installed (1.75 or later)
- PostgreSQL server (local or remote)
- Basic familiarity with Rust and SQL

**What you'll need:**

- A terminal/command line
- Your favorite text editor
- About 30-60 minutes total time

## Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial follows the same pattern:

1. **Clear outcome** - See exactly what you'll build
2. **Step-by-step instructions** - No guessing, just follow along
3. **Immediate feedback** - See results after each major step
4. **Clean completion** - Working code you can build upon

## Next Steps

After completing the tutorials:
- **Solve specific problems** → [How-To Guides](../how-to/)
- **Understand the architecture** → [ETL Architecture](../explanation/architecture/)
- **Look up technical details** → [API Reference](../reference/)
