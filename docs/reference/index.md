# Reference

**Information-oriented** material that provides authoritative, detailed descriptions of the ETL crate's components and behavior.

Reference documentation describes what the crate does, not how to use it. This section is designed for looking up specific information when you already know what you're trying to accomplish.

## Available Reference

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    Reference documentation for the ETL crate is under development and will include:
