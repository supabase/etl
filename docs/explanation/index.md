# Explanations

**Deep dives into ETL concepts, architecture, and design decisions**

Explanations help you build mental models of how ETL works and why it's designed the way it is. These topics provide background knowledge, compare alternatives, and explore the reasoning behind key architectural choices.

## Core Concepts

### [ETL Architecture Overview](architecture.md)
**The big picture of how ETL components work together**

Understand the relationship between pipelines, destinations, stores, and the PostgreSQL replication protocol. Learn how data flows through the system and where extension points exist.

*Topics covered:* Component architecture, data flow, extension patterns, scalability considerations.

## Reading Guide

**New to ETL?** Start with the [ETL Architecture](architecture.md) to understand how the system works.

**Planning a production deployment?** Read [Architecture](architecture.md) to understand system behavior.

**Building extensions?** Check out the [Custom Implementations Tutorial](../tutorials/custom-implementations.md).

## Next Steps

After building a conceptual understanding:

- **Start building** → [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md)
- **Solve specific problems** → [How-To Guides](../how-to/index.md)
- **Look up technical details** → [Reference](../reference/index.md)
